# Graeme-s-Password-Generator
This project is my first experience with JavaScript, creating an array-based system for generating a random password.

To my understanding my assignment was to make the pre-designed HTML and CSS work by only modifying the JavaScript. I had to define arrays of every acceptable character, use window prompts to get the user to select their parameters (how long their password should be, what character types they want, etc.

This is the result: https://threebraincells.github.io/Graeme-s-Password-Generator/
